cat-accordion
=============

This a simple CSS3/HTML/JS focusing accordion. Upon mouse enterance, the photograph that is being hovered over will expand and pull into focus, while the others will contract and remain unfocuses. This allows photographers to have a dramatic effect of showing off their portfolios on their web pages.
